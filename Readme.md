Virtual Pet


(For staff i reccommend enabling dev tools in the bottom of the help page which allows you to manually decrease the stats.)

You begin by clicking new game.

Choose your duck and name it, upon naming it you will be promted with the game screen , lower the game volume if you wish it will be located in the top right.

You will have 4 attributes:

- Happiness
- Hunger
- Cleanliness
- Sleep

Happiness decreased based on the other three stats , if hunger reaches bellow 35 you loose happiness.

Cleanliness reaches bellow 50 you will loose happiness and the same is for sleep.

if all stats fall bellow those levels happiness reaches 0 and the pet dies.

You can save the game at any time and load it back up.

The time of survival is displayed when the duck is dead and also it shows when you last saved.
